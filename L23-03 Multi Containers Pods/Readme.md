Letâ€™s create multiple containers in a Pod using a YAML file.  We'll use the Busybox container to get the default page served by the Nginx container.

## Create the pod

    kubectl create -f two-containers.yaml

## Get some info

    kubectl get pods -o wide
    kubectl describe pod two-containers

## Connect to the BusyBox container

    kubectl exec -it two-containers --container mybox -- /bin/sh

## Fetch the HTML page served by the Nginx container

This will output the content of the Web page in the terminal.

    wget -qO- localhost
Note: Since nginx runs on port 80, we didn't need to specify port no. in above command but if nginx was running on some different port then we need to add port no.

## Quit

    exit

## Cleanup

    kubectl delete -f two-containers.yaml --force --grace-period=0
